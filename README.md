# reversi
Using Python Turtle to play the board game Reversi. This is a robust implementation of the popular board game with both 1- and 2-player options, the former of which plays against a competitive artificially intelligent bot.

## Notes
This is my first significant project in Python. I used the following principles in designing and writing this code:
- **Robust code**: I strove to consider every possible edge case and account for this. Given that the program is heavily user-input based, this became a significant portion of my code. Additionally, there are numerous edge cases when traversing matrices as necessary in this game.
- **Abstraction**: This project is very intensive, has a lot of moving parts, and doesn't use classes (a much-needed implementation, in hindsight). As such, breaking down the large problem into more manageable chunks and tackling them individually makes the code easier to read and more modular. Additionally, choosing how and where to break up code was a significant decision that required forward-thinking.
- **Readability**: Because of the intensive nature of the project, I kept up with what was being done, how it was being done, and why it was necessary for each part of my code (almost to a fault). I did this by using meaningful variable and function names and writing comments (a lot of comments). This way, I along with any other person interested can look at easily follow along the program.
